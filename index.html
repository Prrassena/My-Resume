    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on a project named “VEHICLE SPEED DETECTOR USING AURDINO”.<br>
        Duration - 3 months.<br>
        Description – over speeding of vehicles has become one of the major causes of accidents and killing
        many lives. if the vehicle crosses the limited speed, this system displays the condition of over speed

        a human handled system</li>
        <li>

            Duration - 3 months.<br>
            Description – The aim of image stitching is to detect several images of the same scene and merge them
            to create a larger image. To achieve this, the images must have some common keypoints between images.
            In other words, It can stitch consecutive images by using a small portion from consecutive images must
